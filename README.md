# DarkSirensCosmology

This directory contains all Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks with the analyses developed in the PhD research titled "Gravitational Waves as Indicators of Distance, Density, and Cosmological Velocities."

The .np files are all related to reproducing the results presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14034. All of them require the data present in the "catalogo.csv" file. The analysis using the grid method is found in the following files:
- Caso sem o erro_atualizado.nb
- Erro em z_0.002.nb
- Erro em z_0.02.nb
- Erro em z_0.01.nb

The analysis using the Fisher matrix method is found in the following files:
- Fisher_sem erro.nb
- Fisher_0.002.nb
- Fisher_0.02.nb
- Fisher_0.01.nb
- Comparações_Fisher.nb
